Professional business aesthetic with gradients of blue and green. Graph showing before and after comparison. Tech startup vibe, minimal and sleek. No text overlays.\n\nFor SECURITY commits:\nA professional illustration of secure infrastructure. Lock icon, shield, or encryption visualization. Corporate tech aesthetic with blues and grays. Modern, trustworthy design. Abstract but clearly about security.\n\nFor FEATURE commits:\nA modern illustration showing new capability or feature. Professional SaaS product aesthetic. Clean lines, gradient backgrounds. Tech-forward but accessible. Represents innovation and growth.\n\nFor BUG FIX commits:\nA professional visualization of problem-solving or system reliability. Checkmarks, stable systems, or uptime indicators. Reassuring colors like green and blue. Corporate professional style.\n\nPrompt Template:\n---\nCreate a professional LinkedIn post image for a software engineering announcement about {commit_type}. \n\nTheme: {theme_based_on_commit}\nStyle: Modern tech company aesthetic, clean and minimal\nColors: {brand_colors or professional_blue_green_gradient}\nMood: {innovative/reliable/secure/efficient}\nElements: {relevant_icons_or_visualizations}\n\nRequirements:\n- Professional business context\n- No text overlays or labels\n- 16:9 aspect ratio\n- Suitable for executives and investors\n- Tech-forward but not overly technical\n---\n\nImage Processing:\n1. Call DALL-E 3 API with generated prompt\n2. Receive image URL from OpenAI\n3. Download image from URL (valid for 1 hour)\n4. Upload to S3 for permanent storage\n5. Return S3 URL for LinkedIn posting\n\nError Handling:\n- Content policy violations: Fall back to generic tech imagery\n- API failures: Retry with exponential backoff\n- Download failures: Retry download up to 3 times\n- Invalid images: Log and use fallback placeholder\n\nGo Implementation:\n- Use openai-go SDK (sashabaranov/go-openai)\n- HTTP client for image download\n- AWS SDK for S3 upload\n- Image validation before upload\n\nConfiguration:\n- OPENAI_API_KEY\n- DALLE_IMAGE_SIZE (1024x1024 or 1792x1024)\n- DALLE_QUALITY (hd or standard)\n- DALLE_STYLE (vivid or natural)\n- S3_BUCKET for image storage\n\nCost Optimization:\n- DALL-E 3 HD: 0.080 per image (1024x1024)\n- DALL-E 3 Standard: 0.040 per image\n- Start with Standard quality for MVT\n- Upgrade to HD if quality matters\n- Cache generated images (never regenerate same commit)\n\nAlternative Approach (Post-MVT):\nInstead of pure DALL-E generation, consider:\n1. Template-based images (faster, cheaper, more consistent)\n2. Use image manipulation library (Go imaging packages)\n3. Overlay text, metrics, logos on template backgrounds\n4.

CRITICAL: Sora may still be in limited beta - verify API access and document integration approach.","notes":"## SORA API RESEARCH FINDINGS (November 2025)\n\n### ✅ API AVAILABILITY: YES (Limited)\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Sora 2 API is NOW AVAILABLE through OpenAI platform\n- Official documentation at: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/video-generation\n- API Reference: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/videos\n- Model page: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/sora-2-pro\n\n**Access Methods:**\n1. **Direct OpenAI API** (requires API key)\n2. **Azure OpenAI** (enterprise, preview access)\n\n### 🔑 API ENDPOINTS\n\nBased on Azure documentation (OpenAI uses similar structure):\n\n**1. Create Video Job**\nPOST /v1/videos\n- Async job creation\n- Returns job_id for polling\n\n**2. Check Job Status**\nGET /v1/video/generations/jobs/{job_id}\n- Poll every 5 seconds\n- Status: pending, processing, succeeded, failed, cancelled\n\n**3. Download Video**\nGET /v1/video/generations/{generation_id}/content/video\n- Returns MP4 binary content\n\n### 📝 REQUEST PARAMETERS\n\nRequired:\n- model: 'sora-2' or 'sora-2-pro'\n- prompt: Text description (up to detailed narratives)\n\nOptional:\n- width / height: Resolution (480p, 720p, 1080p, 1920p)\n- n_seconds: Duration (up to 20 seconds max)\n- n_variants: Number of videos to generate\n- size: Aspect ratio presets\n\nAdvanced (image/video inpainting):\n- inpaint_items: Array with file_name, frame_index, crop_bounds\n\n### 💰 PRICING (Estimated)\n\n**Official OpenAI Pricing: NOT YET PUBLISHED**\n\n**Estimated based on third-party sources:**\n- ~$0.10 - $0.50 per second of video\n- Varies by resolution (720p cheaper, 1080p more expensive)\n- Average estimate: $0.40 per 15-second clip = $2.67/video\n\n**For our use case (short commits):**\n- 10-second videos @ $0.20/sec = $2.00/video\n- 100 videos/month = $200/month (Sora costs alone)\n\n**Subscription Tiers (ChatGPT):**\n- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (1,000 credits, ~5s 720p videos)\n- ChatGPT Pro: $200/mo (10,000 credits, watermark-free, priority)\n\n### ⚙️ TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS\n\n**Video Specs:**\n- Max duration: 20 seconds\n- Formats: MP4 output\n- Resolutions: 480p, 720p, 1080p, 1920p\n- Audio: Synchronized audio generation included in Sora 2\n\n**Rate Limits:**\n- Not documented yet (TBD when we get API access)\n- Expect similar to other OpenAI APIs (RPM/RPD limits by tier)\n\n**Generation Time:**\n- UNKNOWN - likely 30 seconds to several minutes per video\n- CRITICAL: This means we NEED async processing (Lambda 15min timeout may work)\n\n**Content Filtering:**\n- Automatic content moderation\n- Harmful prompts rejected with no video generated\n\n### 🚨 PROJECT BLOCKERS RESOLVED\n\n✅ **API EXISTS**: Sora 2 API is available (not vaporware)\n✅ **DOCUMENTATION**: Official OpenAI docs published\n✅ **AUTHENTICATION**: Standard OpenAI API key\n✅ **PROGRAMMATIC ACCESS**: REST API with async job pattern\n\n### ⚠️ REMAINING UNKNOWNS\n\n❓ **API Access**: Do we need special approval or just an API key?\n❓ **Exact Pricing**: Official per-second cost from OpenAI\n❓ **Rate Limits**: Requests per minute/day\n❓ **Generation Time**: How long does a 10-second video take?\n❓ **Geographic Restrictions**: US/Canada only or global?\n\n### 📋 NEXT STEPS\n\n1. **Get API Access**: Sign up at platform.openai.com, get API key\n2. **Test Generation**: Create simple test video to measure:\n   - Generation time (affects Lambda timeout decision)\n   - Actual cost (affects pricing model)\n   - Video quality for commit diffs\n3. **Prompt Engineering**: Test how well commit messages translate to videos\n4. **Rate Limit Testing**: Determine concurrent request limits\n\n### 🎯 RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH PROJECT\n\n**Verdict: ✅ PROJECT IS VIABLE**\n\nThe Sora API is real, available, and well-documented. While pricing is TBD, estimated costs ($2-3/video) are acceptable for a SaaS model with monthly fees.\n\n**Architecture Decision:**\n- Use async processing (SQS + Lambda or ECS Fargate)\n- Start with Sora 2 (standard), upgrade to Pro if quality matters\n- Cache generated videos in S3 (don't regenerate)\n- Implement rate limiting to control costs\n\n**Fallback if too expensive:**\n- DALL-E 3 image sequences + ffmpeg\n- RunwayML Gen-2\n- Pika Labs","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-17T05:25:07.870097-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-17T05:25:07.908949-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-17T05:25:07.908949-08:00","source_repo":"."}

Transform git commits into engaging LinkedIn posts that highlight business impact, technical innovation, and open source value.\n\nUSER PROMPT TEMPLATE:\n---\nRepository: {repo_name}\nProject Description: {repo_description}\nCommit Message: {commit_message}\nCode Changes Summary: {diff_summary}\nCommit Author: {author_name}\n\nCreate a LinkedIn post that:\n1. Starts with an attention-grabbing hook (emoji + benefit statement)\n2. Explains the business problem being solved\n3. Describes the technical solution in accessible terms\n4. Highlights measurable impact (performance, cost, reliability, security)\n5. Emphasizes open source benefits (transparency, no vendor lock-in, community)\n6. Ends with relevant hashtags (3-5 tags)\n7. Length: 500-1000 characters\n8. Tone: Professional but conversational, technical but accessible\n9. Focus on WHY this matters to businesses and users, not just WHAT changed\n---\n\nOutput Requirements:\n- No markdown formatting (LinkedIn strips it)\n- Use emojis sparingly (1-2 max, professional context only)\n- Break into short paragraphs (2-3 lines each)\n- Include metrics when available (percentages, time saved, cost reduction)\n- Avoid jargon, explain technical terms\n- Call to action: encourage following the project, contributing, or sponsoring\n\nExample Transformations:\n\nINPUT: fix: prevent memory leak in cache invalidation\nOUTPUT:\n🔧 Infrastructure Reliability Improvement\n\nFixed a critical memory leak that could cause service degradation over time. Our caching layer now properly releases memory when invalidating old entries.\n\nImpact: Servers can run for weeks without restarts, reducing operational overhead and improving uptime for production deployments.\n\nThis is why open source infrastructure matters - when issues are found, they are fixed transparently and everyone benefits.\n\n#OpenSource #SRE #Infrastructure #DevOps\n\n---\n\nINPUT: feat: add OAuth2 authentication support\nOUTPUT:\n🔐 Enterprise-Ready Authentication\n\nJust shipped OAuth2 support, making it easier for companies to integrate our tool into their existing security infrastructure.\n\nWhy it matters: IT teams can now use single sign-on, enforce MFA policies, and manage access centrally - critical requirements for enterprise adoption.\n\nThis upgrade opens doors for larger organizations who were blocked by authentication requirements. Ready to deploy in your corporate environment.\n\n#EnterpriseIT #Authentication #Security #OpenSource\n\n---\n\nPrompt Variations by Commit Type:\n\nFIX commits: Focus on reliability, stability, user experience\nFEAT commits: Focus on new capabilities, business opportunities, competitive advantage\nPERF commits: Focus on cost savings, scalability, efficiency gains\nREFACTOR commits: Focus on maintainability, technical debt reduction, long-term value\nDOCS commits: Focus on accessibility, adoption, community growth\nTEST commits: Focus on quality, confidence, production readiness\nSECURITY commits: Focus on risk reduction, compliance, trust\n\nSpecial Instructions:\n- If commit mentions metrics (speed, memory, cost), emphasize those numbers\n- If commit fixes a CVE or security issue, highlight the severity and fix\n- If commit enables new use cases, describe who benefits\n- Always connect technical changes to business outcomes\n- For B2B projects, emphasize enterprise readiness and support","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-17T05:25:06.979813-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-17T05:25:07.020725-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-17T05:25:07.020725-08:00","source_repo":"."}
